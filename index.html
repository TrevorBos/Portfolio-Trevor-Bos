        <p>
            My name is Trevor Bos. I just completed the UofT Coding Bootcamp. Now, I am looking for my first full-time job in this field. 
            I have been working as a territory manager with Microsoft for the last two years and many customer service based jobs before that. 
            My job has provided me valuable experience in working with people, collaborating as a team, and developing new ideas. 
            I cannot say for sure what my big career goal is as the world is constantly changing and I try to stay in the now. 
            However, I do know that I can provide a fresh perspective to every project i am a part of. I am open to challenges and look forward to constructive feedback to help me grow. 
            I am open-minded and learn new things quickly. I am hoping to apply my skills in developing high-quality and unique products.
            <br> 
            <br> 
            Outside of work, I enjoy immersing myself in nature; frequently finding myself winding through forest trails with my partner. 
            I also enjoy a bit of friendly competition via card/ board games with friends and getting lost in the newest indie console game.
